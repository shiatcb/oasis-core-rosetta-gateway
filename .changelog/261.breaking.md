Bring Rosetta dependencies up to date

We're updating our Rosetta dependencies, including the
Go SDK, the CLI, and along with those, the Rosetta API
specifications.

- Rosetta CLI: 0.4.0 -> 0.7.3
- Rosetta Go SDK: 0.3.3 -> 0.7.2
- Rosetta API: 1.4.1 -> 1.4.10

Updating the Rosetta API along with its Go SDK is a
significant update and may have introduced breaking
changes.
